# elm-bowling
An Elm + React JS experiment.

## System Requirements

* Elm platform v0.16
* Node JS (for specs)

## Installation

1. `elm package install`

## Usage

For now, use `elm-reactor`.

## Tests

1. `./specs.sh`

This will call `elm make` to compile everything, output it in a format that will run on node instead of the browser, and run the test suites on node.
